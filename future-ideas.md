- multi-year layout one line per month. multiple years in columns.
- on the month-day layout, keep the day numbers where they are, but move the weekday indicator to the same line but muted as gray text.
- on the month-day layout, make weekends be the ultra-light background.
- on the year index - quantize the weekdays to a normalized width? It is maximally using space now which is good, but I like the idea of quantized. Perhaps we should compontentize it and make. That way we can make it preportional to the provided x,y,height,width ばnd if we pass in a width that is divisible by 7 then it will come out to quantized box widths.
- left nav. three leter month indiciators, slightly bolder than the normal week indicators.

- right nav, add automatically bold if the current page in the context is the page you're on. This could be a passed in option too. I don't feel strongly.
- TOC pages for each month.
- a flat toc, not nested.
